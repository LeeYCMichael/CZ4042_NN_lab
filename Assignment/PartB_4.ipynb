    "Model degradation is a common issue faced when deploying machine learning models (including neural networks) in the real world. New data points could exhibit a different pattern from older data points due to factors such as changes in government policy or market sentiments. For instance, housing prices in Singapore have been increasing and the Singapore government has introduced 3 rounds of cooling measures over the past years (16 December 2021, 30 September 2022, 27 April 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "In such situations, the distribution of the new data points could differ from the original data distribution which the models were trained on. Recall that machine learning models often work with the assumption that the test distribution should be similar to train distribution. When this assumption is violated, model performance will be adversely impacted.  In the last part of this assignment, we will investigate to what extent model degradation has occurred.\n"
